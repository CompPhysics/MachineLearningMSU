    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Our emphasis throughout this series of lectures  \n",
    "is on understanding the mathematical aspects of\n",
    "different algorithms used in the fields of data analysis and machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, where possible we will emphasize the\n",
    "importance of using available software. We start thus with a hands-on\n",
    "and top-down approach to machine learning. The aim is thus to start with\n",
    "relevant data or data we have produced \n",
    "and use these to introduce statistical data analysis\n",
    "concepts and machine learning algorithms before we delve into the\n",
    "algorithms themselves. The examples we will use in the beginning, start with simple\n",
    "polynomials with random noise added. We will use the Python\n",
    "software package [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and\n",
    "introduce various machine learning algorithms to make fits of\n",
    "the data and predictions. We move thereafter to more interesting\n",
    "cases such as the simulation of financial transactions or disease\n",
    "models. These are examples where we can easily set up the data and\n",
    "then use machine learning algorithms included in for example\n",
    "**scikit-learn**. \n",
    "\n",
    "These examples will serve us the purpose of getting\n",
    "started. Furthermore, they allow us to catch more than two birds with\n",
    "a stone. They will allow us to bring in some programming specific\n",
    "topics and tools as well as showing the power of various Python (and\n",
    "R) packages for machine learning and statistical data analysis. In the\n",
    "lectures on linear algebra we cover in more detail various programming\n",
    "features of languages like Python and C++ (and other), we will also\n",
    "look into more specific linear functions which are relevant for the\n",
    "various algorithms we will discuss. Here, we will mainly focus on two\n",
    "specific Python packages for Machine Learning, scikit-learn and\n",
    "tensorflow (see below for links etc).  Moreover, the examples we\n",
    "introduce will serve as inputs to many of our discussions later, as\n",
    "well as allowing you to set up models and produce your own data and\n",
    "get started with programming.\n",

    "## Software and needed installations\n",
    "\n",
    "We will make extensive use of Python as programming language and its\n",
    "myriad of available libraries.  You will find\n",
    "IPython/Jupyter notebooks invaluable in your work.  You can run **R**\n",
    "codes in the Jupyter/IPython notebooks, with the immediate benefit of\n",
    "visualizing your data. You can also use compiled languages like C++,\n",
    "Rust, Fortran etc if you prefer. The focus in these lectures will be\n",
    "on Python, but we will provide many code examples for those of you who\n",
    "prefer R or compiled languages. You can integrate C++ codes and R in for example\n",
    "a Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have Python installed (we recommend Python3) and you feel\n",
    "pretty familiar with installing different packages, we recommend that\n",
    "you install the following Python packages via **pip** as \n",
    "\n",
    "1. pip install numpy scipy matplotlib ipython scikit-learn mglearn sympy pandas pillow \n",
    "\n",
    "For Python3, replace **pip** with **pip3**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For OSX users we recommend, after having installed Xcode, to\n",
    "install **brew**. Brew allows for a seamless installation of additional\n",
    "software via for example \n",
    "\n",
    "1. brew install python3\n",
    "\n",
    "For Linux users, with its variety of distributions like for example the widely popular Ubuntu distribution,\n",
    "you can use **pip** as well and simply install Python as \n",
    "\n",
    "1. sudo apt-get install python3  (or python for pyhton2.7)\n",

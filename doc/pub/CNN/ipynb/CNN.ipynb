    "\n",
    "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are very similar to ordinary Neural Networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are made up of neurons that have learnable weights and\n",
    "biases. Each neuron receives some inputs, performs a dot product and\n",
    "optionally follows it with a non-linearity. The whole network still\n",
    "expresses a single differentiable score function: from the raw image\n",
    "pixels on one end to class scores at the other. And they still have a\n",
    "loss function (for example Softmax) on the last (fully-connected) layer\n",
    "and all the tips/tricks we developed for learning regular Neural\n",
    "Networks still apply (back propagation, gradient descent etc etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference? **CNN architectures make the explicit assumption that\n",
    "the inputs are images, which allows us to encode certain properties\n",
    "into the architecture. These then make the forward function more\n",
    "efficient to implement and vastly reduce the amount of parameters in\n",
    "the network.**\n",

    "size, say $200\\times 200\\times 3$, would lead to neurons that have \n",

    "\n",
    "Convolutional Neural Networks take advantage of the fact that the\n",

    "## Layers used to build CNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple CNN is a sequence of layers, and every layer of a CNN\n",
    "transforms one volume of activations to another through a\n",
    "differentiable function. We use three main types of layers to build\n",
    "CNN architectures: Convolutional Layer, Pooling Layer, and\n",
    "Fully-Connected Layer (exactly as seen in regular Neural Networks). We\n",
    "will stack these layers to form a full CNN architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple CNN for image classification could have the architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **INPUT** ($32\\times 32 \\times 3$) will hold the raw pixel values of the image, in this case an image of width 32, height 32, and with three color channels R,G,B.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CONV** (convolutional )layer will compute the output of neurons that are connected to local regions in the input, each computing a dot product between their weights and a small region they are connected to in the input volume. This may result in volume such as $[32\\times 32\\times 12]$ if we decided to use 12 filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **RELU** layer will apply an elementwise activation function, such as the $max(0,x)$ thresholding at zero. This leaves the size of the volume unchanged ($[32\\times 32\\times 12]$).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **POOL** (pooling) layer will perform a downsampling operation along the spatial dimensions (width, height), resulting in volume such as $[16\\times 16\\times 12]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **FC** (i.e. fully-connected) layer will compute the class scores, resulting in volume of size $[1\\times 1\\times 10]$, where each of the 10 numbers correspond to a class score, such as among the 10 categories of the MNIST images we considered above . As with ordinary Neural Networks and as the name implies, each neuron in this layer will be connected to all the numbers in the previous volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transforming images\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs transform the original image layer by layer from the original\n",
    "pixel values to the final class scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that some layers contain\n",
    "parameters and other don’t. In particular, the CNN layers perform\n",
    "transformations that are a function of not only the activations in the\n",
    "input volume, but also of the parameters (the weights and biases of\n",
    "the neurons). On the other hand, the RELU/POOL layers will implement a\n",
    "fixed function. The parameters in the CONV/FC layers will be trained\n",
    "with gradient descent so that the class scores that the CNN computes\n",
    "are consistent with the labels in the training set for each image.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## CNNs in brief\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A CNN architecture is in the simplest case a list of Layers that transform the image volume into an output volume (e.g. holding the class scores)\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are a few distinct types of Layers (e.g. CONV/FC/RELU/POOL are by far the most popular)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each Layer accepts an input 3D volume and transforms it to an output 3D volume through a differentiable function\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each Layer may or may not have parameters (e.g. CONV/FC do, RELU/POOL don’t)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each Layer may or may not have additional hyperparameters (e.g. CONV/FC/POOL do, RELU doesn’t)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed above, CNNs are neural networks built from the assumption that the inputs\n",
    "to the network are 2D images. This is important because the number of features or pixels in images\n",
    "grows very fast with the image size, and an enormous number of weights and biases are needed in order to build an accurate network.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As before, we still have our input, a hidden layer and an output. What's novel about convolutional networks\n",
    "are the **convolutional** and **pooling** layers stacked in pairs between the input and the hidden layer.\n",
    "In addition, the data is no longer represented as a 2D feature matrix, instead each input is a number of 2D\n",
    "matrices, typically 1 for each color dimension (Red, Green, Blue). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting it up\n",

    "## Strong correlations\n",
    "Images typically have strong local correlations, meaning that a small\n",

    "The layers of a convolutional neural network arrange neurons in 3D: width, height and depth.  \n",
    "The input image is typically a square matrix of depth 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **convolution** is performed on the image which outputs\n",
    "a 3D volume of neurons. The weights to the input are arranged in a number of 2D matrices, known as **filters**.\n",

    "\n",
    "Each filter slides along the input image, taking the dot product\n",
    "between each small part of the image and the filter, in all depth\n",
    "dimensions. This is then passed through a non-linear function,\n",
    "typically the **Rectified Linear (ReLu)** function, which serves as the\n",

    "## Systematic reduction\n",

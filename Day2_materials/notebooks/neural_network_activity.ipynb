    "# Fully Connected Neural Networks Activity\n",
    "For this activity you have a dataset with the initial energy of an electron and its final momentum after colliding with a proton of equal energy. Along with these data points are the Q^2 value for the scattering and the x Bjorken, which are both important values in deep inelastic scattering. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is called electron_scattering.np and is formated as px, py, pz, initial Energy, Q^2, x Bjorken inside a numpy array. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to properly train this network you will have to normalize the data so that it is cenerted around zero with most of it between -1 and 1.\n",

We don't have to concern ourselves with how to connect the layers together or how to define the training loop.\n",

    " * Before adding the first fully-connected layer, the convolutional features must be flattened to a 1D vector. See [`layers.Flatten`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Flatten).\n",
    " * The [`tf.nn`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn) module provides access to several common activation functions.\n",
    " * The first layer in the network needs the keyword argument `input_shape` whose value is a tuple that gives the shape of a training example. This shape is already extracted from the data in the cell below, and just needs to be passed to the first layer."

    "In this example, we are going to do things a little differently. For the MNIST data, we constructed our own CNN and trained it from scratch. That worked really well for us because it was a small network, small dataset, and relatively easy problem. In practice, designing and training high-performing CNNs from scratch is time consuming and requires large-scale resources. So it is often best not to try to do this yourself. Luckily, companies like Google have already done the heavy lifting for us. TensorFlow provides access to several high-quality networks that have already been trained on datasets with millions of diverse images (such as [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org)) as general computer-vision models. These complex networks have been trained to identify objects from up 1000 categories. This may not seem immediately useful, but it turns out that training these models on such a large scale forces the networks to learn to extract features are are broadly applicable to many computer vision tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "So rather than being a hero and training a CNN from scratch, we can instead use the pretrainined convolutional layers from one of these published models and add our own fully-connected classification layers on top. We keep the weights of the convolutional layers frozen, since we know they are already very good at feature extraction, and only update the weights of the top layers, which do the actual classification. This is much faster than training a CNN from scratch, and it can also result in better performance.\n",
    "\n",

    "Before we actually load the model, there is one final caveat. The VGG network requires that its input images have three channels. Our images currently only have one, so we will add two more channels with the same values as the first. The new image dimensions should be 128 x 128 x 3."

In practice, though, we are not always afforded this luxury. Aquiring large amounts of high-quality labeled data is often very challenging. In fact, the whole reason we want to train a classifier for the AT-TPC is so that humans don't need to hand-label the data! So while we could train the network on the real data, we are instead going to try *transfer learning*. This is when we train a model on one data distribution and try to transfer what it learns to a different distribution. In our case, we will train on the simulated data and save the real data for testing. Labeled simulated data is usually readily available in large quantities, so we want to try to use that to our advantage.\n",

    "One final concept we will introduce here is a *validation set*. This is a third set of data that the network will not see during training, and we can use it to evaluate the performance of the model. Unlike the test set, though, we can use the feedback from the validation data to make adjustments that improve the model's performance. Then the final evaluation will be done with the test data.\n",

    "Note that training this model will take substantially longer than with the MNIST data. There are a couple of reasons for this. Obviously the network is much larger, and even though we are only training the top layers, there is still an expensive forward pass through the entire network. Also, our AT-TPC images are much larger than the MNIST data, in width, height, and number of channels. This should give you an idea for how these problems scale and why we like to start from networks that have already been trained on millions of images (rather than doing it ourselves).\n",

This marks the onset of overfitting, which we want to avoid.

The network has never seen any of the real data before, and since the simulated data is not entirely accurate, we can't expect the network to know everything about the real data. Supervised learning models are generally very good at interpolation, but not extrapolation.\n",

# Welcome to the Summer School on Machine Learning applied to Nuclear Physics, May 20-23, 2019, organized by the Facility of Rare Isotope Beams theory alliance (FRIB-TA).

### Venue: Facility of Rare Isotope Beams and National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, 640 S. Shaw Lane, Michigan State University, East Lansing, 48824 Michigan

All learning material and teaching schedule pertinent to the course is avaliable at this GitHub address. A simple _git clone_ of the material gives you access to all lecture notes and program examples. Similarly, running a _git pull_ gives you immediately the latest updates.

## Course content

Probability theory and statistical methods play a central role in science. Nowadays we are
surrounded by huge amounts of data. For example, there are about one trillion web pages; more than one
hour of video is uploaded to YouTube every second, amounting to 10 years of content every
day; the genomes of 1000s of people, each of which has a length of more than a billion  base pairs, have
been sequenced by various labs and so on.
This deluge of data calls for automated methods of data analysis, which is exactly what machine learning provides. 
The purpose of this summer school is to provide an introduction to the core concepts and tools of machine learning in a manner easily understood and intuitive to physicists and nuclear physicists in particular. We will start with some of the basic methods from supervised learning, such as various regression methods before we move into deep learning methods for both supervised and unsupervised learning, with an emphasis on the analysis of nuclear physics experiments and theoretical nuclear physics. 
Hands-on examples will be provided and the aim is to give the participants an overview on how machine learning can be used to analyze and study nuclear physics problems. 

###  The following topics will be covered
- Basic concepts, expectation values, variance, covariance, correlation functions and errors;
- Estimation of errors using cross-validation, blocking, bootstrapping and jackknife methods;
- Optimization of functions
- Linear Regression and Logistic Regression;
- Boltzmann machines;
- Neural networks;
- Decisions trees and nearest neighbor algorithms

All the above topics will be supported by examples, hands-on exercises and project work.


## Practicalities

1. Five lectures per day Monday through Wednesday, starting at 830am, see schedule below
2. Hands-on sessions in the afternoons till 6pm
3. The last day, Thursday, is dedicated to solving explicit problems with hands-on guidance and relevant examples.
